# Wordpress car rent plugin

![alt text](https://github.com/Volmarg/Wordpress-car-rent-plugin/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

Wordpress plugin created for car pickups renting. 
Looks simple but contains:
- parser for dates/season/price range table,
-- furthermore picking specific range, and price depending on the start/end date that user picked, like for example there can be 3 price ranges in certain range which have to be switched on certain days,
- validation of user inputs,
- mailing with confirmation,
- simple js animations,
- RWD,
- backend editor of prices/seasons/user requests/car types/descriptions etc.

Can't provide full code as it was made on demand - only sample.
